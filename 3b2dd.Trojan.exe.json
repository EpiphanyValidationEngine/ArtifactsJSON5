Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts. Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes to hide and masquerade their malware. Other tactics\u2019 techniques are cross-listed here when those techniques include the added benefit of subverting defenses.

Packing an executable changes the file signature in an attempt to avoid signature-based detection. Most decompression techniques decompress the executable code in memory.\nUtilities used to perform software packing are called packers. Example packers are MPRESS and UPX. A more comprehensive list of known packers is available,  but adversaries may create their own packing techniques that do not leave the same artifacts as well-known packers to evade defenses.\nAdversaries may use virtual machine software protection as a form of software packing to protect their code. Virtual machine software protection translates an executable's original code into a special format that only a special virtual machine can run. A virtual machine is then called to run this code.", "signatures": [{"severity": "UNKNOWN", "description": "Manalize Local SandBox Packer Harvesting"}]}]}]}}, "links": {"self": "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/3b2dd5625b4d07e1162cdb7ef5554af730c1b5b2d2a9f270b5d985d93d982bc1/behaviour_mitre_trees"}}
